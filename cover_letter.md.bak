## Cover Letter


Dear Michael,

My name is Javier Ballester and I'm the friend of Vicent Moll that visited your company at the beginning of March. Vicent told me that you are looking for a draftsman/mechanical engineer to be part of your workforce, and he sent me the requirements. We both think that I could perform that task. I don't speak Dutch (yet), my English reading and writing are far better than my speaking and listening (nothing that a more frequent use can't solve) and have no experience in the food industry but I've been trained in AutoCAD and SolidWorks in my time at the university and have been using them (mostly SolidWorks) for 3D modeling, 2D planing and structure analysis in the projects I've done since then. In addition, I have several years experience as industrial design engineer, some of them (a year and two months in Tejas Borja S.A and a small part of my later work) related to industrial machinery.

I've been playing for years with the idea of going abroad to live and work, I've always found it exciting (and, being sincere, a bit frightening), new country, new language, new culture. Now, with the economic situation in Spain without any signs of improvement and the recent breakup with my girlfriend, fear have diminished, excitement gone up and I've been translating my CV and preparing a portfolio, sending them to a few job agencies and planning a trip to the Netherlands in the next months to attend job interviews... but the prospect of traveling already with a job in which I'll be working with a lifelong friend like Vicent, in a company like yours and in CAD/CAE, something that I'm passionate about, makes the decision even easier. So, please find my CV attached or online in https://javimixet.github.io and feel free to contact me upon any questions or doubts.

I shall be looking forward for your reply.

Kind Regards.

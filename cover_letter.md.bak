## Cover Letter

Dear Michael,

My name is Javier Ballester and I'm the friend of Vicent Moll that visited your company at the beginning of March. Vicent told me that you are looking for a draftsman/mechanical engineer to be part of your workforce and sent me the requirements. We both think that I could fulfill that function. I don't speak dutch (yet) and have no experience in the food industry but I've been trained in Autocad and SolidWorks in my time at university and have been using them (mostly SolidWorks) for 3D modeling, 2D planing and structure analysis in the projects I've worked since then (you can see images of projects here https://javimixet.github.io/portfolio/ most of the ones from 2004 to 2006 and the ones in 2013 were modeled and assembled with SolidWorks). In addition, I have several years experience as industrial design engineer, some of them (a year and two months in Tejas Borja S.A and a small part of my later work) related to industrial machinery.

I've been playing with the idea of going abroad to live and work for years, I always found it exciting (and, being sincere, a bit frightening), new language, new culture, new weather... Now, with the economic situation in Spain without any signs of improvement and a recent breakup with my girlfriend, the fear have diminished and I've been translating my CV, sending it to a few job agencies and planning a trip in a few weeks to attend job interviews... but the perspective of working with a lifelong friend, in a company like yours and in CAD/CAE, something that I'm passionate about, makes the ratio fear/excitement close to zero. So, I would like you to have me in mind for the job. Please find my CV attached or online in https://javimixet.github.io and feel free to contact me upon any questions or doubts.

I shall be looking forward for your reply.

Respectfully yours,
Javier Ballester

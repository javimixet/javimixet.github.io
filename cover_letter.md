Mr. / Mrs.

I had the opportunity to inquire about your company, the working conditions and basically its career path. To my surprise, I found excellent references about the company that you manage and also found that its growth has been steady. For this reason I have a strong interest to be part of its workforce within the nursing field.

I recently graduated as a surgical nurse at the University of Barcelona and I have done my professional practice at the city Clinical Hospital. I have advanced skills in French and English languages and also have the ability to easily adapt to changes and new working environments. I am interested in working abroad, since here in Spain the opportunities are limited, especially for recent graduates. If my profile is of your interest, I invite you to review my attached resume and contact me to arrange a meeting at your convenience.

Sincerely,

To whom it may concern,

In May of this year I got my degree in nursing at the University of Madrid. For this reason, I am seeking my first employment where I can extend and apply in a practical way the knowledge I have acquired.

On the other hand, I also have interest in living in another country, not only because of the currently crisis situation in Spain, but also because this experience is a good opportunity for growth and personal development.

I look forward to hearing a favourable reply shortly.

Yours sincerely,
